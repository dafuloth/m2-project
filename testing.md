# Testing

For this project I have chosen to do automated testing using Jest. Compared to manual testing this is a more efficient way to test so by having Jest tests I reduce the amount of time-consuming manual testing I would otherwise have to do.

These are tests I will run regularly during development to make sure I have not broken anything and ensure that everything is working as intended. Whenever I add a new feature, I make sure to add an accompanying test for and where necessary, I update the tests to ensure they reflect the actual state of the project. Additionally, the tests serve as a form of documentation and would help other developers to understand the project.
