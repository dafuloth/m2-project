# Milestone 2 Project: Tic-Tac-Toe game

This project implements the game of Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts & Crosses) in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Design Decisions

### Colour scheme & Accessibility

Colour scheme has been selected with accessibility in mind. For example, player colours were initially red and green but that could have made the game difficult to play for people with colour blindness (Deuteranopia). 

Therefore, I have opted for the following colours, which have better contrast for players with colour blindness:

- **Player X**: Vivid Orange (`#fb923c`) 
- **Player O**: Ice Blue (`#7dd3fc`)
